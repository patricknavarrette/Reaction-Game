## Reaction-Game

These are step by step instructions to create your own reaction game using a Raspberry Pi and a breadboard. The game has an LED that lights up at random times as well as two switches, each switch intended to be controlled by a player. When the LED light is turned on, each player should try to press their button as fast as possible, whichever player hits their button first wins the game.

To create this game you will need:
- Raspberry Pi
- Breadboard
- Two male-to-male jumper cables
- Four male-to-female jumper cables
- LED light of any color
- Two push button switches
